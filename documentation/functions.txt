                        or the result of the previous execution
        e.g.Run:        example inside w3m. When w3m is runnig
        e.g.Key:        example in keymap. if the exmaple shows something like
                        e.g.Key EXTERN_LINK  copy_url.sh    in the file
                        ~/.w3m/keymap this should look something like
                        keymap yf       EXTERN_LINK  copy_url.sh
        e.g.Run/key:    example that works in the both above
        Test:           Testing to figure out what the funcitions do things
